On a Computer (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)\n\n| Step | What to Do | Tips & Tricks |\n|------|------------|---------------|\n| **1. Sign In** | Click the **Sign\u202fin** button at the top\u2011right and log into your Google account. | Playlists are saved to your account, so you can access them from any device. |\n| **2. Find a Video** | Open any YouTube video you want to add. | You can add videos from any channel\u2014no need to be the owner. |\n| **3. Add to Playlist** | Below the video, click **Save** (the three\u2011line/plus icon). | - If you already have playlists, they\u2019ll appear as check\u2011boxes.<br>- To create a new one, click **+ Create new playlist** at the bottom. |\n| **4. Name Your Playlist** | Give it a clear, descriptive title (e.g., \u201cMorning Workout Mix\u201d). Choose **Public**, **Unlisted**, or **Private**. | - **Public**: anyone can see it.<br>- **Unlisted**: only people with the link can view.<br>- **Private**: only you can see it. |\n| **5. Set a Description (optional)** | Add a short description to help you remember the purpose. | Good for SEO if you plan to share it publicly. |\n| **6. Add More Videos** | Repeat steps 2\u20113 for each video you want to include. | Use the **Add to queue** button (if you have the \u201cAdd to queue\u201d pane open) to quickly stack multiple videos. |\n| **7. Reorder & Edit** | Go to **Library** \u2192 **Playlists** \u2192 click the playlist name. Drag\u2011and\u2011drop videos to reorder, or click the three\u2011dot menu next to each video for options: **Remove**, **Move up/down**, **Add to another playlist**. | - Hold **Shift** while dragging to move several videos at once.<br>- Use the **Search** bar inside the playlist editor to find a specific video quickly. |\n| **8. Set a Playlist Thumbnail** (for public/unlisted) | Click the **Edit** (pencil) button on the playlist page \u2192 **Change thumbnail** \u2192 select a frame from any video in the list or upload a custom image (recommended size: 1280\u202f\u00d7\u202f720\u202fpx). | A compelling thumbnail makes the playlist more clickable when shared. |\n| **9. Enable/Disable Autoplay** | At the top of the playlist, toggle **Autoplay** on/off. | Autoplay will automatically play the next video after the current one ends. |\n| **10. Share Your Playlist** | Click **Share** \u2192 copy the link or use the social\u2011media icons. | For **Private** playlists, you can\u2019t share a link; you\u2019d need to make it unlisted or invite collaborators (see \u201cCollaborative playlists\u201d below). |\n\n#### Advanced Features\n\n| Feature | How to Use | Why It\u2019s Useful |\n|---------|------------|-----------------|\n| **Collaborative Playlists** | In the playlist\u2019s **Edit** screen, toggle **Collaborators** \u2192 copy the shareable link and give it to friends. | Great for group projects, road\u2011trip mixtapes, or classroom resources. |\n| **Smart Playlists (Auto\u2011Add)** | Use the **Add videos automatically** option (available for some channel owners) or create a **YouTube \u201cMix\u201d** by adding a set of keywords. | Keeps the playlist fresh with new content matching your criteria. |\n| **Loop a Playlist** | Click the **Loop** icon (circular arrows) at the top of the playlist. | Perfect for background music or study sessions. |\n| **Download for Offline (YouTube Premium)** | If you have Premium, open the playlist on the mobile app \u2192 tap **Download** \u2192 choose quality. | Watch without an internet connection. |\n| **Export/Import** | Use third\u2011party tools (e.g., **Exportify**, **Playlist Buddy**) to export a CSV of your playlist URLs or import a list of video URLs. | Handy for backup or migrating playlists between accounts. |\n\n---\n\n### B. On a Mobile Device (YouTube App \u2013 Android & iOS)\n\n| Step | What to Do | Tips |\n|------|------------|------|\n| **1. Open the YouTube app** | Make sure you\u2019re signed in. | Tap your **profile picture** \u2192 **Your channel** \u2192 **Playlists** to see all existing ones. |\n| **2.

Right\u2011click the video \u2192 **Stats for nerds** \u2192 note the **Dropped frames**.<br>2. Disable hardware acceleration: `Settings \u2192 Advanced \u2192 System \u2192 Use hardware acceleration when available` (toggle off, then restart Chrome). |\n| **\u201cThis video is unavailable in your country\u201d** | Use a reputable VPN extension (e.g., **NordVPN**, **ExpressVPN**) or the **Google Chrome \u201cLocation Spoofing\u201d** developer tool (`Ctrl+Shift+I \u2192 Network \u2192 Override geolocation`). |\n| **Captions not showing** | Click the **CC** button, then **Settings \u2192 Subtitles/CC \u2192 Auto\u2011",
